Enhanced the dataset such that the samples were increased to 8-fold the original number, by basically performing rotation of samples into eight different angles. Due to the large number of samples in the training dataset, the model was trained better than the prior models, resulting in improved accuracy. The model takes MRI images of the brain and detects the type of brain tumor.
